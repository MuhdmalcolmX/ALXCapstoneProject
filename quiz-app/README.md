# Mohammed Quiz App

The goal of this project was to develop a fully functional Quiz App that allows users to select trivia categories, answer questions, track their scores, and view their results. This project involved integrating the Open Trivia Database API to fetch dynamic questions, implementing a timer, and providing visual feedback to enhance the user experience. The app was designed to be responsive, offering a smooth experience across devices, and deployed using Vercel.
